4. What tasks are implemented? AVL, K-ary tree, Dynamic Array, Binomial Heap*Dequeue is broken

5. What tasks are attempted but did not finish? Binomial Heap*Dequeue

6. What tasks are left without trying?

7. What are the known bugs in your code?  Something in dequeue in binomial heap is causing null pointers. After walking through code I found it does restructure
heap correctly but the head is wrong somewhere.

8. Analysize the difference between these four different priority queues in terms of the running time of the following methods. 

- Enqueue |Bi-nomial Heap : O(log n) | Dynamic Array: O(n) worst case have to send new element to front| K-ary Tree: O(logk(n)) | AVL Tree: O(logn)
- Dequeue |Bi-nomial Heap : O(log n) | Dynamic Array: O(n) | K-ary Tree: O(klogk(n)) | AVL Tree: O(logn)
- Merge   |Bi-nomial Heap : O(log n) | Dynamic Array: O(n) | K-ary Tree: O(n*(logk(n))) | AVL Tree: O(nlogn)

9. Other comments. 
Binomial heap was hell for me.
